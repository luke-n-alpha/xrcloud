# AGENTS

This repository uses `.agents/context/caret-rules.json` as the single source of truth (SoT).
Read `caret-rules.json` first. Load workflows from `.agents/context/workflows/` on demand.
If the standard structure is missing, run `/init` to scaffold and populate it from templates.
Human-readable guidance lives under `docs/` (Korean + English).
